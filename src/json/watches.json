If we weren’t able to improve on the design – we could certainly enhance both quality and comfort: This watch can now be retrofitted with sapphire crystal upon request."

      "Watches in the Oyster Perpetual range are direct descendants of the original Oyster, the world’s first waterproof wristwatch, on which Rolex has built its reputation since 1926. These watches benefit from all the fundamental features of the Oyster Perpetual collection – excellent chronometric precision, a waterproof Oyster case, and self-winding of the movement via a Perpetual rotor. Displaying hours, minutes and seconds, made exclusively of Oystersteel and featuring a sophisticated finish, these are chronometer wristwatches in their purest form. The anti-reflective coating applied to the back of the sapphire crystal on the new generation Oyster Perpetual ensures optimal legibility of the dial."

      "IWC's Pilot's Watches were developed over 80 years ago as rugged and reliable instruments for airborne celestial navigation. That also determined the distinctive instrument look that has characterized the watches' design to this day. This version of the Pilot's Watch Automatic 36 was inspired by the iconic design of the Pilot's Watch Mark XVIII. The diameter of just 36 millimetres not only makes the watch a perfect fit for a slightly slimmer wrist: it also marks a return to the original size of the Mark 11 navigation watch, which was produced in Schaffhausen for the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1948. The watch has a stainless-steel case, a black dial and rhodium-plated hands. The technical features include a soft-iron inner case to protect the movement against magnetic fields and a front glass that was specially secured against sudden drops in pressure."

The accentuation of the hours, minutes and seconds plus the satinized stainless steel case are what give the watches their sporty yet elegant appearance. The crystal of the 556 watches is made from sapphire crystal, as is the transparent back which provides an intriguing insight into the filigree mechanical movement inside."

      "The Pilot’s Watch Mark XVIII Edition “Le Petit Prince” is a special-edition timepiece dedicated to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s little prince. In both form and function, this watch reflects the ideal established by classic pilot’s watches. Like cockpit instrumentation, the clearly organized dial is reduced to essentials, and legibility is a top priority. The watch, which is water-resistant to 6 bar, is powered by an automatic 35111-calibre movement, meets the requirements of professional pilot’s watches in terms of precision and has a 42-hour power reserve. With its soft-iron inner case, it is optimally shielded against the influence of magnetic fields. The midnight blue dial and the brown calfskin strap with its cream coloured quilted stitching, which is reminiscent of Saint-Exupéry’s flight suit, make this a particularly eye-catching timepiece."

In the crisp, dry air, and when driven across the slopes by the wind, this snow has a special light and delicate quality that is captured in the subtly textured surface of the dial. The blue tempered steel seconds hand moves over it in the perfect glide motion that is Spring Drive’s unique signature and reflects the continuous, eternal and beautiful nature of time."
